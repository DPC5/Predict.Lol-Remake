# Predict.Lol Remake

This is a web app built to further my skills with programming stemming off of the original idea made with python to predict the outcome of league of legends matches using algoriths.

## How It Works
This app will take in individual player stats and be fed into an algorithm to predict the average impact a player carries in each game (SR | Summoner Rating). To predict a match, the application can use these calculated summoner ratings after a draft has been locked in and then it can determine the outcome of the match.

## Goals
Later I hope to scale this up and predict the outcome of pro matches and possibly make a fantasy league style website.
